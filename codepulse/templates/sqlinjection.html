                <p>
                    SQL Injection (SQLi) is a common attack vector that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software
                    by injecting malicious SQL statements into input fields for execution (e.g., data fields). This can allow
                    attackers to manipulate or steal data from an organization's SQL databases.

                <h2>How SQL Injection Attacks Occur</h2>
                <p>
                    SQLi occurs when an attacker is able to insert a series of SQL statements into a 'query' that are then executed
                    by a web application's database server. This often happens through unsanitized input fields where user inputs
                    are not properly checked or escaped.

                <h2>Types of SQL Injection Attacks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>In-band SQLi:</strong> The most straightforward kind of attack, where the attacker uses the same communication channel to inject SQL code and gather results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inferential SQLi:</strong> Also known as Blind SQLi, this type of attack asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based on the application's response.</li>
                    <li><strong>Out-of-band SQLi:</strong> Data is transmitted over a protocol other than the one used to manage the database, such as HTTP.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Preventing SQL Injection Attacks</h2>
                <p>
                    Prevention strategies for SQL Injection primarily focus on proper input validation and query parameterization. Here are some effective practices:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use Prepared Statements:</strong> With parameterized queries, it's impossible for an attacker to alter the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply Whitelisting:</strong> Instead of rejecting bad patterns, identify and allow only necessary inputs to pass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employ Stored Procedures:</strong> While they are not completely immune, using them properly can help reduce SQL Injection risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Escape All User Inputs:</strong> Although not a primary defense, escaping inputs can help mitigate some forms of SQLi.</li>
                </ol>
